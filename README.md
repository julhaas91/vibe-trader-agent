## Utils
### Google storage
Set google environmental variables for google, see example in .env.example

## How to use google cloud storage
```python 
from utils import init_storage_client, upload_pdf
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv('../../.env')

from io import BytesIO
from reportlab.pdfgen import canvas


def generate_pdf() -> bytes:
    """Generate a dummy PDF for example purposes."""
    buffer = BytesIO()
    pdf = canvas.Canvas(buffer)
    pdf.drawString(100, 100, "Generated PDF Content")
    pdf.save()
    pdf_bytes = buffer.getvalue()
    buffer.close()
    return pdf_bytes

# Initialize client
project_id = os.getenv('GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT')
if not project_id:
    raise ValueError("GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT environment variable is not set")

gcs_client = init_storage_client(project_id=project_id)
content_pdf_bytes = generate_pdf()

# Upload with signed URL (valid for 7 days)
url = upload_pdf(
    client=gcs_client,
    bucket='vibe-trader-reports-dev',
    destination="test_pdf.pdf",
    content=content_pdf_bytes,
    make_public=True,
    expiration_days=7
)
print(f"File uploaded successfully. Access URL: {url}")
```
Using this example u can upload any object converting into bytes stream.
If you specify make_public - as output you will get link to uploaded file.
